# 🎄 Advent of Code – My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** programming puzzles.  
Each folder represents a specific day’s challenge, and inside you'll find:

- Python solution files for each part of the puzzle  
- The input file used for that day’s problem

- taskname1.py → Solution for Part 1  
- taskname2.py → Solution for Part 2  
- test.txt → Puzzle test input for that day (No actual input due to creator restrictions)

## 🧠 Goals

- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Practice clean, readable Python code  
- Track my yearly progress through Advent of Code challenges  

---

## ▶️ Running a Solution

Run Part 1:

python Day-1/taskname1.py

Run Part 2:

python Day-1/taskname2.py

Make sure to execute scripts from the repository root so they can correctly read input.txt.

## ⭐ Notes

- These solutions are written for learning, experimentation, and fun.
- Inputs may be omitted for certain years due to Advent of Code rules restricting redistribution.
